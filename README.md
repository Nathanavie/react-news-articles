# react-news-articles
This project uses a NewsApi.org API of the latest US news articles from some large news organisations and displays them in a responsive CSS Grid layout

# Getting started
You can view a live demo over at insert link

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

React will start the project on port 3000 which you can access via localhost:3000.

# API
The API that is used within this project can be found at https://newsapi.org/.

The api that was used contained the latest set of news articles posted from the US.

## ToDo
- Add a search to allow a topic to be chosen using a word query rather than just US articles
- Add a country selection to change the country that the api is called from
